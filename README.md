# 🛠️ Simplified Design Patterns 🎨

Welcome to our repository dedicated to design patterns! Here, we explore fundamental concepts that drive the structuring and organization of code in software projects.

### What are Design Patterns?

Design patterns are proven solutions to recurring problems in software development, providing guidelines and abstractions to make code more flexible, scalable, and easy to maintain. They offer a common language for discussing solutions to common problems.

### Why are They Important?

Understanding design patterns is essential for any software developer, as they help create more structured, reusable, and understandable code. Additionally, they promote good design and software architecture practices.

### 📚 Patterns Explored

In this repository, you'll find concise explanations and simple examples of some popular design patterns:

1. [Singleton](https://readme.so/pt/patterns/singleton.md): Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.
    
2. [Strategy](https://readme.so/pt/patterns/strategy.md): Allows defining a family of algorithms, encapsulating them, and making them interchangeable.
    
3.  [Facade](https://readme.so/pt/patterns/facade.md): Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.

## ⚙️ Features

This project uses several design patterns to keep the code organized and efficient. Here’s a quick look at each one:

- 🏆 **Singleton Pattern**  
   - ✅ Ensures only one instance of a class exists.
   - ✅ Managing logging
   - ✅ Provide a single point of entry for the system.

- 🏆 **Strategy Pattern**  
   - ✅ Allows for different algorithms or behaviors that can be switched at runtime.
   - ✅ Great for cases like offering multiple payment options or different sorting methods.

- 🏆 **Facade Pattern**  
   - ✅ Provides a unified interface to simplify interaction with complex subsystems.
   - ✅ Acts as a “front desk,” handling interactions with other classes and subsystems in the background.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Feel free to explore the code examples and learn more about how to apply these patterns in your own projects. Each pattern has a clear explanation and a small example project to facilitate understanding and implementation.

## 📝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have any suggestions for improvement or want to add new design patterns, feel free to submit a pull request.
